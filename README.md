# Library Database Design website

## Description:
A productivity organizer for visualizing and adjusting your projects and tasks for the week.

Each day of the week gets a column, and each area/project gets a row. The user can then input tasks pertaining to each area/project â€“ represented as text in moveable boxes. Then each task box can be dragged and dropped as things change.

## Features:
* Written purely with PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, MySQL (no frameworks)
* Designed database schema with full CRUD support for accounts, projects, tasks
* Designed with UX in mind (e.g., input validation, persistent and context-aware navigation)
* Security across the board:
  * Form inputs sanitized and validated on client and server (prepared statements, regular expressions)
  * Passwords salted and hashed
  * URL access restriction
* Supports session management, persisting state across pages (e.g., permissions, errors, login state)
* Supports account signup, login, logout
* Uses PHP data access object (a design pattern) for database operations
* Customizable grid layout, task boxes, colors, checkboxes
* Product branding, content pages
